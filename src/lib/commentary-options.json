    "In response to the Government’s National Policy Statement on Urban Development (NPS-UD) 2020 (amended 2022) and requirements of the Resource Management Act, Auckland Council have implemented Plan Change 78: Intensification.  These legislative changes mean that the Council must:\n\tEnable more development in the city centre and at least six-storey buildings within walking distance of the City Centre, Metropolitan Centres and Rapid Transit Stops\n\tEnable more intensive development in and around neighbourhood, local and town centres\n\tIncorporate Medium Density Residential Standards that enable three storey housing in most residential areas\n\tImplement qualifying matters that reduce the required height and density of development where there is a feature or value that should be protected or avoided\nUnder the proposed zone – Plan Change 78, the property has a zoning of Residential – Mixed Housing Suburban.  This zone is to be the most widespread residential zone in Auckland.  Its density controls allow a moderate level of intensification, while retaining a relatively spacious quality consistent with a suburban residential character, compared to the Mixed Housing Urban and Terrace Housing and Apartment Buildings zones.  \nSubdivision and development within the zone allows two dwellings per site as a permitted activity and three or more dwellings being a restricted discretionary activity.  Further, development of two dwellings will need to comply with the following standards within the Mixed Housing Suburban zone:\nBuilding Height\nHeight in relation to boundary\nMinimum yard depth setbacks from each boundary\nMaximum impervious area\nBuilding coverage\nLandscaped area\nOutlook space\nDaylight ingress\nOutdoor living space\nFencing and wall restrictions\nSubdivision for three or more dwellings within this zone, while being restricted discretionary will also need to comply with the following standards within the zone, building height; height in relation to boundary and minimum yard depth setbacks from each boundary. \nVacant proposed site subdivision is a restricted discretionary activity within this zone and allows a net site area of 400 sm for parent sites that are less than one hectare.  For parent sites that are in excess of one hectare, vacant proposed site subdivision is a discretionary activity with the following rules regarding site areas:\nMinimum net site area\t320 sm\nMinimum average net site area\t400 sm\nMaximum average net site area\t480 sm\nThe Mixed Housing Suburban zone aims to enable a variety of housing types and encourage development as it is the most wide-spread residential zone under the unitary plan.  The zone is concentrated around residential use but allows for non – residential activities that will support the social and economic well-being of the community while monitoring any effects on the residential amenity of the zone.\n"
