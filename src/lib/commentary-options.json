  "MarketComment": [
    "The housing market outlook remains mixed, with cautious optimism driven by increased mortgage pre-approvals and improving auction clearance rates. Expected OCR cuts may boost buyer eligibility, while investors benefit from tax reforms and equity growth. However, rising unemployment poses a risk, potentially leading to more forced sales. House prices are projected to grow moderately, contingent on stable employment and controlled construction costs. As such, a moderate level of risk remains."
