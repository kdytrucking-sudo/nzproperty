GDP grew 1.1% year-on-year in Q1 2025 and 0.8% quarter-on-quarter, surpassing expectations. Treasury has now revised full-year 2025 GDP growth to 1.7%, with further acceleration to 2.9% expected by mid-2026. These upward revisions are supported by improving consumer confidence and household spending, though business investment remains patchy. \n   The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has cut the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 225 basis points since August 2024, with the most recent July 2025 Monetary Policy Statement keeping the OCR steady at 3.25%.

  "globalEconomicOverview": "    As of mid-2025, the global economy is navigating a complex environment shaped by intensified trade tensions, ongoing geopolitical conflicts, and divergent monetary policies. The United States maintains significant tariff measures introduced in April 2025, including a 145% tariff on Chinese imports and a minimum 10% tariff on imports from over 180 countries, with limited exemptions for Canada and Mexico. These policies have reinforced global trade fragmentation.\n    China’s reciprocal tariffs, up to 125% on key U.S. exports, coupled with restrictions on critical rare earth materials, continue to disrupt supply chains. These trade dynamics contributed to a $5.4 trillion decline in U.S. equity market value since April. \n    As of mid-2025, the global economy is navigating a complex environment shaped by intensified trade tensions, ongoing geopolitical conflicts, and divergent monetary policies.

  "residentialMarket": "    New Zealand’s housing market remained in a state of cautious recovery through July 2025, with a 0.3% quarterly decline in national average values, according to QV. This marks a moderation of earlier gains recorded in the first quarter of the year and indicates a market that is stabilising rather than accelerating. The recent softening follows a 1.8% annual decline as at Q1 2025, a recovery from the sharper 4.1% drop during the “mini downturn” of March to September 2024. The overall market trajectory continues to be underpinned by easing monetary conditions, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) having delivered 225 basis points of Official Cash Rate (OCR) cuts since August 2024, bringing the OCR to 3.25% as at July 2025.\n     Mortgage rates have followed suit, with 1-year fixed rates now averaging 4.89%–4.90% across major lenders, and 2-year rates hovering around 4.99%. This easing in credit conditions has improved affordability, particularly for first-home buyers, who continue to make up approximately 27% of all residential purchases. However, the national median house value remains well below peak, sitting at NZ$770,000 as at June 2025, which is still approximately 16–20% below its late-2021 peak. Nonetheless, the return of mortgage interest deductibility for investors from April 2025 and a broader lift in pre-approval activity are bolstering demand across the board. \n    New Zealand’s housing market remained in a state of cautious recovery through July 2025, with a 0.3% quarterly decline in national average values, according to QV.

  "localEconomyImpact": "The housing market outlook remains mixed, with cautious optimism driven by increased mortgage pre-approvals and improving auction clearance rates. Expected OCR cuts may boost buyer eligibility, while investors benefit from tax reforms and equity growth. However, rising unemployment poses a risk, potentially leading to more forced sales. House prices are projected to grow moderately, contingent on stable employment and controlled construction costs. As such, a moderate level of risk remains."
