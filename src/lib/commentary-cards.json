Site sizes range from 165 sm - 216 sm, with an average of around 177 sm. The analysed land and building rates vary from approximately $8,540 psm - $9,560 psm, with an average of about $8,890 psm. Generally, the lower end of this range reflects larger townhouse units, while the higher end relates to smaller dwellings.\nOf particular note, within the subject development the remaining three lots are either sold or currently under contract. Lot A and Lot C, which have identical configurations, floor areas, and similar land sizes, both occupy road-front positions. These have transacted or are under contract between May 2025 and the present at prices ranging from $1,255,000 - $1,300,000, reflecting analysed land and building rates of $8,840 psm - $9,570 psm.\nOn balance, and taking into account the physical attributes of the property including its age, size, condition, views, and aspect, together with also allowing for the prevailing market conditions, we believe the subject property would warrant a market value ranging between $1,250,000 – $1,290,000, and we deem it appropriate in this instance to adopt the mid-point of this range at a figure of $1,270,000, which reflects a land and building rate of approximately $8,950 psm, comfortably within the evidence range outlined above.\""

These sales reflect analysed land and building rates of approximately $11,524 psm to $12,302 psm.
